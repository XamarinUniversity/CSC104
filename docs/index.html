		<h2>Before you begin</h2>
      <p>
         This is a Xamarin cross-platform class about C#. To complete the coding exercises, you will need a Xamarin development environment (Mac or Windows) to run the exercise on. Please read the <a href="https://university.xamarin.com/resources/setup-requirements">setup requirements</a> if you need help installing the Xamarin development environment.
      </p>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>
			This session explores how to add behaviors into your C# applications through the use of methods. It begins with a reminder of classes, fields and methods and then goes through the process of defining a method, calling a method, passing parameters, returning values, and method overloading. The exercises enable you to put these concepts into practice through building a simple calculator.
	  </p>
	
		<h2>Objectives</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Create a class with methods to provide behavior</li>
			<li>Utilize properties to hide our fields</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Exercises</h2>
		<p>
			Exercise materials are available from <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/CSC104/">GitHub</a>. The code can be cloned through a desktop Git client or <a href="https://github.com/XamarinUniversity/CSC104/archive/master.zip">downloaded directly</a> as a ZIP file.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<div class="objective">Building a Calculator</div>
				<a href="./parts/part1.html">Exercise</a>
				<br />
				In this lab, you will define a <code>Calculator</code> class with some methods to perform simple arithmetic operations.
			</li>

			<li>
				<div class="objective">Adding onto our Calculator</div>
				<a href="./parts/part2.html">Exercise</a>
				<br />
				Here, you will add some new behavior into your calculator by adding an overloaded method to perform modulo division (finding the remainder).
			</li>
            
            <li>
				<div class="objective">Working with properties</div>
				<a href="./parts/part3.html">Exercise</a>
				<br />
				In this final exercise, you will hide the field details through the use of properties and auto-properties. 
			</li>
